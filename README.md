- 👋 Hi, I’m @CFJ207
- 👀 I’m interested in programming using Python. I am a chemical engineer by profession and works in a food manufacturing company as supervisor. I am here today (June 27, 2023) to take my first step to do what I love, that is computer programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming and hoping to broaden my knowledge with the help of GitHub.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python projects such as automation and database.
