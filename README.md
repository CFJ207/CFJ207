- 👋 Hi, I’m @CFJ207
- 👀 I’m interested in programming using Python. I am a chemical engineer by profession and works in a food manufacturing company as supervisor. I am here today (June 27, 2023) to take my first step to do what I love, that is computer programming. I may be a beginner but my passion on computer programming will thrive me to excellence. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python programming and hoping to broaden my knowledge and increase my experience with the help of GitHub.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python projects such as automation and database. I am well versed in using Selenium and Beautiful Soup libraries.
